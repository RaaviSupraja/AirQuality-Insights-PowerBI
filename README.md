## Data Used

**Data** - Daily Data of over 500 places in India

**Data Location** - Download real-time data from the Government of India <a href="https://www.data.gov.in/resource/real-time-air-quality-index-various-locations" target="_blank">Here</a>.

**Data Cleaning & Analysis** - MS Excel

**Data Visualization** - PowerBI

## Questions

  - Which cities have the highest average pollutant levels?
  - What are the top 5 most polluted areas based on average pollutant levels?
  - What is the most dominant pollutant type in the country?
  - Which pollutants are more problematic in specific regions?
  - How many areas are Unhealthy and Hazardous?

## Summary of Findings

 - There are a total of 15 Unhealthy Areas and 7 Hazardous Areas in the country.
 - Ozone is the most dominant pollution type across India.
 - MadhyaPradesh is dominated by CO pollution.

## Suggestions

 - Reduce Vehicle Emissions: Use public transportation, carpool, bike, or walk whenever possible
 - Support Clean Energy: Advocate for and support policies that promote renewable energy sources like wind and solar power.
 - Green Spaces: Plant trees and create green spaces to absorb pollutants and improve air quality
 - Engage with Local Authorities: Work with local governments to implement and enforce air quality regulations

## Limitations

- Some records had * and NA pollutant values and these were modified to zero during cleaning.
- Only few major towns and cities were available with data. More studies at the Industrial areas could give accurate analysis.
